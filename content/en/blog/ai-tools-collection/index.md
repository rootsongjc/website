Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing our lives, making our work more efficient and intelligent. In this rapidly developing field, there are many practical AI tools that can help us better accomplish our work. In the future, mastering various AI tools to optimize your workflow and improve work efficiency will be a necessary skill for everyone. It's time to gather some cheap and practical AI tools. Below are some recommended practical AI tools that are worth collecting. You can directly use these tools without additional programming knowledge. Most of these tools are free to use, or provide free usage quotas, or have low usage costs.

## 1. ChatGPT

![ChatGPT](chatgpt.jpg)

[ChatGPT](https://chat.chatgpt.com/) is an intelligent chatbot based on GPT technology, which can interact with users in natural language. It uses deep learning technology and large-scale trained language models to understand users' questions and provide useful answers.

ChatGPT can answer various questions, and users can directly input questions or topics on the website and get quick and accurate answers. It should be noted that ChatGPT is an online chatbot, and its answers may not be 100% accurate. In addition, the data that ChatGPT model is trained on is up to 2021, and it is still in the early development stage, and is constantly improving and optimizing.

**Recommendation Reasons**

ChatGPT's response speed is super fast, and you can get an answer in a few seconds, which is especially suitable for situations where quick replies are needed. You can also use OpenAI's API to create your own tools. However, the free version of ChatGPT's response speed is sometimes slow, and frequently refreshing the page is required when following up, and there are also limits on the number of characters for questions and answers.

The commonly used functions include:

- Writing code
- Translation
- Proofreading articles
- Summarizing an article (you can output a URL)
- Learning a knowledge area that you are not familiar with

In addition, a ChatGPT desktop application is recommended: [https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT), as well as the ChatGPT prompt project [https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts).
