This article uses Istio's official [bookinfo sample](https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/bookinfo/) to explain how Envoy performs routing forwarding after the traffic entering the Pod and forwarded to Envoy sidecar by iptables, detailing the inbound and outbound processing. For a detailed analysis of traffic interception, see [Understanding Envoy Sidecar Proxy Injection and Traffic Interception in Istio Service Mesh](https://jimmysong.io/blog/envoy-sidecar-injection-in-istio-service-mesh-deep-dive/).

## Overview of Sidecar Injection and Traffic Interception Steps

Below is an overview of the steps from Sidecar injection, Pod startup to Sidecar proxy interception traffic and Envoy processing routing.

1. Kubernetes automatically injected through Admission Controller, or the user run `istioctl` command to manually inject sidecar container.
2. Apply the YAML configuration deployment application. At this time, the service creation configuration file received by the Kubernetes API server already includes the Init container and the sidecar proxy.
3. Before the sidecar proxy container and application container are started, the Init container started firstly. The Init container is used to set iptables (the default traffic interception method in Istio, and can also use BPF, IPVS, etc.) to Intercept traffic entering the pod to Envoy sidecar Proxy. All TCP traffic (Envoy currently only supports TCP traffic) will be Intercepted by sidecar, and traffic from other protocols will be requested as originally.
4. Launch the Envoy sidecar proxy and application container in the Pod.

{{<callout note>}}
**Sidecar proxy and application container startup order issues**

Start the sidecar proxy and the application container. Which container is started first? Normally, Envoy Sidecar and the application container are all started up before receiving traffic requests. But we can't predict which container will start first, so does the container startup order have an impact on Envoy hijacking traffic? The answer is yes, but it is divided into the following two situations.

**Case 1: The application container starts first, and the sidecar proxy is still not ready**

In this case, the traffic is transferred to the 15001 port by iptables, and the port is not monitored in the Pod. The TCP link cannot be established and the request fails.

**Case 2: Sidecar starts first, the request arrives and the application is still not ready**

In this case, the request will certainly fail. As for the step at which the failure begins, the reader is left to think.

**Question** : If adding a readiness and living probe for the sidecar proxy and application container can solve the problem?

5. TCP requests that are sent or received from the Pod will be hijacked by iptables. After the inbound traffic is hijacked, it is processed by the Inbound Handler and then forwarded to the application container for processing. The outbound traffic is hijacked by iptables and then forwarded to the Outbound Handler for processing. Upstream and Endpoint.
6. Sidecar proxy requests Pilot to use the xDS protocol to synchronize Envoy configurations, including LDS, EDS, CDS, etc., but to ensure the order of updates, Envoy will use ADS to request configuration updates from Pilot directly.

## How Envoy handles route forwarding

The following figure shows a `productpage`service access request `http://reviews.default.svc.cluster.local:9080/`, when traffic enters `reviews` the internal services, `reviews` internal services Envoy Sidecar is how to do traffic blocked the route forward.

![Istio transparent traffic hijacking and traffic routing schematic](sidecar-iptables.webp)

Before the first step, `productpage` Envoy Sidecar Pod has been selected by EDS of a request to `reviews` a Pod service of its IP address, it sends a TCP connection request.

The Envoy configuration in the official website of Istio is to describe the process of Envoy doing traffic forwarding. The party considering the traffic of the downstream is to receive the request sent by the downstream. You need to request additional services, such as `reviews` service requests need Pod `ratings` service.

`reviews`, there are three versions of the service, there is one instance of each version, three versions sidecar similar working steps, only to later `reviews-v1-cb8655c75-b97zc` Sidecar flow Pod forwarding this step will be described.

## Understanding the Inbound Handler

The role of the inbound handler is to transfer the traffic from the downstream intercepted by iptables to localhost to establish a connection with the application container inside the Pod.

Look `reviews-v1-cb8655c75-b97zc` at the Listener in the pod.

Run `istioctl pc listener reviews-v1-cb8655c75-b97zc` to see what the Pod has a Listener.

```ini

0.0.0.0            15006     TCP  <--- Receives all inbound and outbound traffic to the pod from IP tables and hands over to virtual listener
```

As from `productpage` traffic arriving `reviews` Pods, downstream must clearly know the IP address of the Pod which is `172.33.3.3`, so the request is `172.33.3.3:9080`.

**Virtual Listener**

As you can see from the Pod's Listener list, the 0.0.0.0:15001/TCP Listener (the actual name is `virtual`) listens for all inbound traffic, and the following is the detailed configuration of the Listener.

```json
{
    "name": "virtual",
    "address": {
        "socketAddress": {
            "address": "0.0.0.0",
            "portValue": 15006
        }
    },
    "filterChains": [
        {
            "filters": [
                {
                    "name": "envoy.tcp_proxy",
                    "config": {
                        "cluster": "BlackHoleCluster",
                        "stat_prefix": "BlackHoleCluster"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "useOriginalDst": true
}
```

**UseOriginalDst** : As can be seen from the configuration in `useOriginalDst`the configuration as specified `true`, which is a Boolean value, the default is false, using iptables redirect connections, the proxy may receive port [original destination address](http://www.servicemesher.com/envoy/configuration/listener_filters/original_dst_filter.html) is not the same port, thus received at the proxy port It is 15001 and the original destination port is 9080. When this flag is set to true, the Listener redirects the connection to the Listener associated with the original destination address, here `172.33.3.3:9080`. Listener If no relationship to the original destination address, the connection processing by the Listener to receive it, i.e. the `virtual`Listener, after `envoy.tcp_proxy`forwarded to a filter process `BlackHoleCluster`, as the name implies, when no matching Envoy virtual listener when the effect of Cluster , will send the request to it and return 404. This will be referred to below Listener provided `bindToPort` echoes.

**Note** : This parameter will be discarded, please use the Listener filter of the [original destination address](http://www.servicemesher.com/envoy/configuration/listener_filters/original_dst_filter.html) instead. The main purpose of this parameter is: Envoy listens to the 15201 port to intercept the traffic intercepted by iptables via other Listeners instead of directly forwarding it. See the [Virtual Listener](https://zhaohuabing.com/post/2018-09-25-istio-traffic-management-impl-intro/#virtual-listener) for details .

**Listener 172.33.3.3_9080**

As mentioned above, the traffic entering the inbound handler is `virtual` transferred to the `172.33.3.3_9080` Listener by the Listener. We are looking at the Listener configuration.

            "filters": [...
            ]
        }
    ],
...
}]
```

**bindToPort** : Note that there are a [`bindToPort`](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.6.0/api-v1/listeners/listeners) configuration that is `false`, the default value of the configuration `true`, showing Listener bind to the port, set here to `false` the process flow can Listener Listener transferred from the other, i.e., above said `virtual` Listener, where we see filterChains.filters in the `envoy.http_connection_manager` configuration section:

```json
"route_config": {
                            "name": "inbound|9080||reviews.default.svc.cluster.local",
                            "validate_clusters": false,
                            "virtual_hosts": [
                                {
                                    "domains": [
                                        "*"
                                    ],
                                    "name": "inbound|http|9080",
                                    "routes": [
                                        {
                                            ...
                                            "route": {
                                                "cluster": "inbound|9080||reviews.default.svc.cluster.local",
                                                "max_grpc_timeout": "0.000s",
                                                "timeout": "0.000s"
                                            }
                                        }
                                    ]
                                }
                            ]
                        }
```

This configuration indicates that traffic will be handed off to the Cluster for `inbound|9080||reviews.default.svc.cluster.local` processing.

**Cluster `inbound|9080||reviews.default.svc.cluster.local`**

Run `istioctl pc cluster reviews-v1-cb8655c75-b97zc --fqdn reviews.default.svc.cluster.local --direction inbound -o json` to see the Cluster configuration is as follows.

```json
[
    {
        "name": "inbound|9080||reviews.default.svc.cluster.local",
        "connectTimeout": "1.000s",
        "hosts": [
            {
                "socketAddress": {
                    "address": "127.0.0.1",
                    "portValue": 9080
                }
            }
        ],
        "circuitBreakers": {
            "thresholds": [
                {}
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

You can see that the Endpoint of the Cluster directly corresponds to localhost, and then the traffic is forwarded by the application container after iptables.

## Understanding the Outbound Handler

Because the `reviews` will to `ratings` send an HTTP request service, request address are: `http://ratings.default.svc.cluster.local:9080/` the role of Outbound handler is to intercept traffic to iptables to native applications sent via Envoy to determine how to route to the upstream.

The request sent by the application container is outbound traffic. After being hijacked by iptables, it is transferred to the Envoy Outbound handler for processing, then passed through `virtual` Listener and `0.0.0.0_9080` Listener, and then finds the cluster of upstream through Route 9080, and then finds Endpoint through EDS to perform routing action. 

**Route 9080**

`reviews` requests `ratings` service, run `istioctl proxy-config routes reviews-v1-cb8655c75-b97zc --name 9080 -o json` view route configuration because Envoy VirtualHost will be matched according to HTTP header of domains, so the following list only `ratings.default.svc.cluster.local:9080` this one VirtualHost.

```json
[{
    "name": "ratings.default.svc.cluster.local:9080",
    "domains": [
        "ratings.default.svc.cluster.local",
        "ratings.default.svc.cluster.local:9080",
        "ratings",
        "ratings:9080",
        "ratings.default.svc.cluster",
        "ratings.default.svc.cluster:9080",
        "ratings.default.svc",
        "ratings.default.svc:9080",
        "ratings.default",
        "ratings.default:9080",
        "10.254.234.130",
        "10.254.234.130:9080"
    ],
    "routes": [
        {
            "match": {
                "prefix": "/"
            },
            "route": {
                "cluster": "outbound|9080||ratings.default.svc.cluster.local",
                "timeout": "0.000s",
                "maxGrpcTimeout": "0.000s"
            },
            "decorator": {
                "operation": "ratings.default.svc.cluster.local:9080/*"
            },
            "perFilterConfig": {...
            }
        }
    ]
},
..]
```

You can see the routing of traffic to the Cluster from this Virtual Host configuration `outbound|9080||ratings.default.svc.cluster.local`.

**Endpoint `outbound|9080||ratings.default.svc.cluster.local`**

Istio 1.1 previous versions do not support the use of `istioctl` commands to directly query Endpoint Cluster, you can use the debug queries Pilot endpoint way compromise.

```bash
kubectl exec reviews-v1-cb8655c75-b97zc -c istio-proxy curl http://istio-pilot.istio-system.svc.cluster.local:9093/debug/edsz > endpoints.json
```

`endpoints.json` file contains all the Endpoint information of the Cluster, and we only select `outbound|9080||ratings.default.svc.cluster.local` the results of the Cluster as follows.

```json
{
  "clusterName": "outbound|9080||ratings.default.svc.cluster.local",
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "locality": {

      },
