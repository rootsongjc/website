## Changes and Reminders for ICA Certification

Upcoming policy change: Please note that the ICA certification expiration policy will change on April 1, 2024, at 00:00UTC. Certifications obtained on or after this date will expire 24 months after meeting the certification requirements (including passing the exam). We encourage anyone interested and prepared to schedule and take the exam before the policy change. Please see more detailed information [here](https://example.com).

The current certification validity period is 3 years, and certifications obtained after April 1st will be valid for 2 years.

## Background on Tetrate Academy

[Tetrate Academy](https://academy.tetrate.io/), operated by Tetrate, has been around for several years, launching Istio fundamentals tutorials, Envoy fundamentals tutorials, and CIAT certification exams, with over 13,000 people having taken Tetrate Academy courses. In September last year, Tetrate contributed CIAT to CNCF, renamed it [ICA exam](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/istio-certified-associate-ica/), and the certification exam was officially launched in November.
