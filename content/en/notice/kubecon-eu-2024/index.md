I am excited to announce that I will be attending this year's KubeCon & CloudNativeCon event, and it will be my first time having the opportunity to attend KubeCon in Europe. I am greatly looking forward to meeting everyone in Paris and sharing insights and experiences about cloud-native technologies. In addition to participating in the main event, I will also be attending [Istio Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/co-located-events/istio-day/) and will be available at Tetrate's booth (J14) to meet with everyone. I hope to spend this exciting time with you all and welcome you to come and chat with me!
